# Multiplayer Battleship Game
This is a multiplayer battleship-like game I made as a college assignment.  
It uses the PyQT framework for the interface, SQLite for database management (WIP) and System V IPC for multiplayer.  
The latter connects two processes on the same machine, making a pseudo-multiplayer experience.
